# virginiatech.github.io

This repo provides the source for https://virginiatech.github.io/


## Development

The site is built using Jekyll, so you can either install Ruby and all the gems yourself or use Docker. Once Docker is installed, you can simply run

```bash
docker-compose up
```

and then open your browser to http://localhost:4000/.  Any changes made to the source will be built immediately.
